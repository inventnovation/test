    <p>One of Ovis’ most impressive pieces of technology is its capability to understand what it sees. Through a series of complex algorithms, we have created an AI with the ability to not only “see” as we do, but comprehend what it is seeing. What's more, Ovis' side follow technology is far more advanced then following from behind because of the requirement of prediction algorithms. With these state of the art algorithms, Ovis is able to easily stay by your side at all times so you don’t have to be constantly looking over your shoulder just to see your luggage.</br></br>The obstacle avoidance algorithm of Ovis is based on self-driving technology. This innovative technology is able to accurately sense and assess the environment, calculate the distance, and estimate the direction and route to avoid potential obstacles, with a deviation precision of +/- 1cm.</p>

    <p>A problem facing many smart-luggage providers is being up to TSA-approved standards and the high amplitude batteries the other companies install in the luggage. With Ovis, this isn’t even a worry. With the press of one button, you can pop out the battery, go through security and then pop it in and continue enjoying your hands-free luggage.</p>

    <p>Ovis' large interior volume of 34L can easily hold enough items for a whole week trip. With durable yet lightweight material, Ovis makes your travel lite and smart. </p>

    <p>Deciphering the concept of unibody design, Ovis provides you the greatest efficiency and performance with the premium material that is both durable and lightweight. To ensure an extra protection, carbon fiber is used for the corners of Ovis’ wheels. </p>

    <p>Clocking in at a speed of 3m/s, Ovis’ revolutionary rear-wheel drive operates quieter and more swift than traditional wheels. Along with this, if at any point you are like many of us and forget to charge your possessions, Ovis is still a completely functional piece of luxury luggage even at zero percent battery! When the battery of Ovis dies, all four wheels become omni-directional, allowing a smooth roll on the ground and a buttery smooth luggage drag.</p>

    <p>A favorited feature of Ovis is its capability to charge any and all of your devices on the go. Free yourself from searching for outlets in the airport! With Ovis, you always have the capability to plug in any device so you can stay up to date on social media, or finish the last bit of work before you get on the plane.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn.static.forwardx.com/igg/weight.gif">
    <p>One of the most valuable features of Ovis is the ability to know how much your luggage weighs at any point so you never have to worry about being overweight for your carry-on. Ovis is able to track the weight in real-time by a system of complex mathematical equations relating to how hard the motor is working, and how far Ovis has traveled. This can simplify life beyond belief when you are packing so you don’t over-pack or worry about under-packing.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn.static.forwardx.com/igg/smartband.gif">
    <p>With many “hands free” devices we are always in constant worry that even though the system says it is fool proof, we might lose our valuables at any point. With Ovis, this isn’t a worry due to the Anti-Lost Smart Alarm. The smartband will vibrate the second that your Ovis is more than 2 meters away from you. It also alerts the owner when the battery of Ovis is running low or when Ovis is experiencing other problems that might need tech support from us.</p>
    <img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529661632/xiekm9loijgyosjzt7h1.png">
    <img src="https://cdn.static.forwardx.com/igg/switch.gif">
    <p>By simply grabbing the handle, you cut all motor power and engage manual mode. This implies that you can drag the luggage at your wish. When Ovis is switched to manual mode, all four wheels become omni-directional, allowing a smooth roll on the ground and a buttery smooth luggage drag.</p>

    <p>If our smart alarm is not enough for you because you may not feel or hear the alarm during the peak of stress, there is constant GPS tracking enabled to ensure you will never lose track of your luggage again. Equipped with GPS and 3G technology, and presented as an individual, cut-resistant, modularized luggage tag, the location tracker of Ovis provides you real-time monitoring and tracking of your belongings - anytime & anywhere.

*If you wish to purchase the GPS location tracker, please select the bundle perk which includes one Ovis and one GPS location tracker.</p>
